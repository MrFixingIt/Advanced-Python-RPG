---------- Main Stories ----------

(4 of 6)    (5 points): As a data analyst, I want to make at least five commits on GitHub with descriptive messages.  

(2.5 points): As a user, I want the results of each attack to be printed to the terminal.
(5 points): As a user, I want the Hero and Enemy to continue attacking each other until one's health reaches zero.  
(5 points): As a user, I want to be able to “loot” defeated enemies by adding the Enemy's equipment set to the Hero's 
equipment Set
(5 points): As a data analyst, I want the game to conclude when the Hero's health reaches 0, or when all three Enemies have 
been defeated.   
(2.5 points): As a data analyst, I want to create a run_game() function, which calls my other functions in a logical order 
to determine the game's flow. 
(5 points): As a data analyst, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do 
just one thing!  

Bonus Stories
(5 points): As a user, I want to “loot” defeated enemies by adding the Enemy's gold, silver, and copper coins to the 
appropriate value in the Hero's coin Dictionary.

(7.5 points): As a user, I want to increase my Hero's level after defeating an Enemy, which will include: 
Incrementing my Hero's level by 1 
Adding a new attack of my choosing to my Hero's Attack Tuple. 
Checklist
 
Start coding the program first by going from the top of the user stories and working down. Decide how you will: 
Randomly select a  Hero's attack
Randomly select an Enemy's attack 
Decrement the Hero and Enemy's health accordingly 
Repeat the process until the Hero or Enemy loses all of their health 
Once you are able to have your Hero and Enemy attack one another, start thinking about how you will handle the post-battle functionality, including: 
Printing a message declaring the winner
“Looting” the defeated enemy's equipment
Repeating the same battle process for the other two enemies 
Be sure to test your code as you complete each function!
