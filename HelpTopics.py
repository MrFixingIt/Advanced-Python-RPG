----- 1st Question: -----
Take this line from my fisrt loop for example. (line 138) I created a variable to plug into this f-string (line 49) but I would prefer to pull the info that I need directly from the dictionary but I keep getting errors.

print("Garen at {h_health} attacks Melee Minion with Decisive Strike for 30 dmg")
# Do I need to fix this? Or leave it as is?

----- 2nd Question: -----
I don't understand this.
(2.5 points): As a data analyst, I want to create a run_game() function, which calls my other functions in a logical order 
to determine the game's flow.

----- 3rd Question: -----
How am I doing with this?
(5 points): As a data analyst, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do 
just one thing! 

----- 4th Question: -----
The assignment says to add a new attack of my choosing to my Hero's Attack Tuple. 
- BUT -
Instead of adding a new attack, I added passive abilities. Is that ok?

----- 5th Question: -----
Do I need to import Dictionary Variables from other files or can I keep it ALL in one file?
